# D_FLIP_FLOP_Verification_UVM
This project verifies a D Flip-Flop design using SystemVerilog and UVM. The UVM environment tests correct data capture on the rising clock edge, proper reset behavior, and stable output response. A scoreboard is used to compare expected and actual outputs, ensuring functional accuracy and reliable operation.
